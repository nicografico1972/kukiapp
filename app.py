  "prompt": "A square 800x800 geometric abstract composition, a close-up fragment of an infinite pattern. The design is a complex interplay of interlocking geometric shapes including triangles, squares, rhombuses, circles, and arcs, forming larger star-like, cross-like, and knot-like structures. The shapes overlap and connect dynamically, without a rigid grid, creating a sense of depth through layering. The aesthetic is clean, flat design, modern textile art, and concrete art, inspired by M.C. Escher tessellations and modern quilt patterns. The colors are strictly limited to a user-defined palette of [COLOR_1], [COLOR_2], [COLOR_3], [COLOR_4], and [COLOR_5], with [COLOR_1] as the dominant background color. No gradients or textures, only solid color fields with sharp edges. The composition feels balanced yet dynamic, suggesting movement and infinite continuation beyond the frame. --ar 1:1"
